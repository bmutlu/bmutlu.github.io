I am Sheldon B. and Marianne S. Lubar Professor of [Computer Science](http://cs.wisc.edu/), [Psychology](http://psych.wisc.edu/), and [Industrial Engineering](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/isye.html) at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](http://wisc.edu/) and the director of the [People and Robots Laboratory](http://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/). I received my PhD degree from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu/)‘s [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](http://hcii.cs.cmu.edu/) in 2009.

I am the chief editor of the [HRI section of the journal Frontiers in Robotics & AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/sections/human-robot-interaction#). If you are an HRI researcher interested in publishing in a rigorous, open-access venue, please submit! I am also an associated editor of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/hhci20/current) and [Foundations and Trends® in Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.nowpublishers.com/HCI). I am also the secretary-treasurer of the [HCI Consortium](http://hcic.org/).
