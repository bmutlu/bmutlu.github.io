I am Sheldon B. and Marianne S. Lubar Professor of [Computer Science](http://cs.wisc.edu/), [Psychology](http://psych.wisc.edu/), and [Industrial Engineering](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/isye.html) at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](http://wisc.edu/) and the director of the [People and Robots Laboratory](http://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/). I received my PhD degree from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu/)‘s [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](http://hcii.cs.cmu.edu/) in 2009.

I am the chief editor of the [HRI section of the journal Frontiers in Robotics & AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/sections/human-robot-interaction#). If you are an HRI researcher interested in publishing in a rigorous, open-access venue, please submit! I am also an associated editor of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/hhci20/current) and [Foundations and Trends® in Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.nowpublishers.com/HCI). I am also the secretary-treasurer of the [HCI Consortium](http://hcic.org/).

If you are interested in joining the People and Robots Lab, please read [this page](/joining).

## Research

My research in [human-robot interaction (HRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human–robot_interaction) builds human-centered principles and methods to enable effective and intuitive interactions between people and robotic technologies and facilitate the successful integration of these technologies into human environments. Below are highlights from ongoing projects in the [People and Robots Lab](http://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/).
