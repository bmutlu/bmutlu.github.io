This line of work involves the development of conversational, robotic, and computer-mediated communication (CMC) interfaces for individuals with social deficits to improve social participation among individuals who suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI), for older adults to reduce social isolation, and for participants of online social gathering to minimize social exclusion. In this line of work, I collaborate with:
