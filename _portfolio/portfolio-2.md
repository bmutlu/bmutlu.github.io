A key thread of my work involves designing novel interfaces for collaborative robots to facilitate their intuitive and effective use and their successful adoption to industrial settings. Collaborative robots hold tremendous promise for small-scale manufacturing and task automation, although existing interfaces for control and programming are significant bottlenecks to their effective use and widespread adoption.

In this line of work, I explore new ways of enabling operators to effectively use robotic arms and engineers to form successful human-robot teams. My collaborators include:

* Micheal Gleicher
* Robert Radwin
* Michael Zinn

Advisees involved in this line of work include:
* Emmanuel Senft
* Danny Rakita
* Pragathi Praveena
* Curt Henrichs
* Kevin Welsh

Some of the methods and systems we have built in this line of work include:

**Mimicry control** — a new interface that enable operators to control a robotic arm by moving their own arms in free space and the robot mimicking operator movements — Paper 1, Paper 2, Talk

**RelaxedIK** — a new optimization-based real-time controller for robot arm motion that minimizes motion discontinuities, kinematic singularities, and jerky, undesirable motions — Paper, Talk

**Camera-in-hand robot** — a new way to providing remote teleoperation support using a second robot carrying a camera tasked to autonomously provide a view of the task environment — Paper, Talk

**Bimanual teleoperation** — an extension of mimicry control to bimanual scenarios, while enabling coordination between the two robotic arms [Paper | Talk]
